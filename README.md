# 🌤 Weather Assistant

## 📌 Project Overview
**Weather Assistant** is an AI-powered weather forecasting application that provides real-time weather updates for any location. It is built using **FastAPI for the backend** and **Tkinter for the frontend**, making it a lightweight and efficient weather app.  

The application fetches weather data from an external API and displays it in a **user-friendly and visually appealing UI**. Users can enter any city name to get current weather details and a **5-day forecast**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
| Component  | Technology Used |
|------------|----------------|
| **Backend** | FastAPI (Python) |
| **Frontend** | Tkinter (Python GUI) |
| **Weather Data** | OpenWeatherMap API |
| **Deployment** | Local (can be extended to cloud services) |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub |

## 🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ **User Inputs City Name** → The user enters the name of the city in the Tkinter-based GUI.  
2️⃣ **Frontend Sends Request** → The Tkinter app sends a request to the FastAPI backend.  
3️⃣ **Backend Fetches Weather Data** → The backend contacts an external weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).  
4️⃣ **Data Processing** → The API response is processed, extracting temperature, humidity, conditions, and forecasts.  
5️⃣ **Displaying Results** → The processed weather data is displayed in the Tkinter frontend with a **colorful and interactive UI**.
